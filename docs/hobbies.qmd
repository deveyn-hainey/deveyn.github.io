# My Hobbies

## Hiking

Hiking is one of my favorite hobbies because it allows me to explore nature, stay active, and find peace away from the city. I enjoy challenging myself with harder trails and reaching new summits. Living in Colorado gives me endless beautiful places to hike, and I'm always planning my next adventure!


## Baking

Baking is my creative outlet at home. I love experimenting with different recipes, from breads to cakes. I'm pretty good at baking cookies and always trying to perfect my chocolate chip recipe. Baking also lets me share delicious treats with friends and family, which is very rewarding.

## Traveling

Traveling opens my mind to new cultures, food, and experiences. I enjoy planning trips, discovering hidden gems, and meeting people from around the world. Whether it's a road trip through the U.S. or visiting another country, traveling always leaves me inspired and grateful.
